Before running the model the following libraries must be present in your system.
LIBRARIES REQUIRED:-
1. Numpy
2. Dlib
3. Pafy
4. face_recognition
5. open cv
6. os
7. cmake
8. umutils
9. datetime


DATA REQUIRED:- 
shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat :- This file is required to mark the coordinates on our face (highly important).



FUNCTION:-

-->We have made the user defined function for face recognition as well as for face extraction.
1. user defined face extraction.ipynb : This file is for face extraction
2. user defined facial recognition.ipynb: This file is for facial recognition 
(Important reminder: Due to some system configuration we were not able to compile and make a user defined facial recognition function as it was taking too long
(2-3 hours just to read the part of all the files) So have seperated the function itno 3 parts namely facial recognitioon with webcam, facial recognition with youtube videos and facial recognition with videos in system.) 


-->Just in case the user defined functions don't work we have made separate files for face recognition as well as for face extraction.


IMPORTANT:-
FILES YOU HAVE TO RUN:-
1. user defined facial extraction.ipynb
2. facial recognition with webcam.ipynb
3. facial recognition with youtube.ipynb 
4. facial recognition with videos in system.ipynb
