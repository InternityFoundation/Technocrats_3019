Before running the model the following libraries must be present in your system.
LIBRARIES REQUIRED:-
1. Numpy
2. Dlib
3. Pafy
4. face_recognition
5. open cv
6. os
7. cmake
8. umutils
9. datetime


DATA REQUIRED:- 
1. shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat :- This file is required to mark the coordinates on our face (highly important).
We have to download this file from the given provided link because we were not able to upload more than 25MB file.
Link to .dat file:  
https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2&sa=D&ust=1594452190551000&usg=AFQjCNFLWBTveYphUvObp1CysdqkNku-oA

2. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml




FUNCTION:-

-->We have made the user defined function for face recognition as well as for face extraction.
1. user defined face extraction.ipynb : This file is for face extraction
2. facial recognition.ipynb: This file is for facial recognition 
(Important reminder: Due to some system configuration we were not able to compile and make a user defined facial recognition function. So have seperated the function itno 3 parts namely facial recognitioon by webcam, facial recognition by youtube videos and facial recognition by internal memory.) 



IMPORTANT:-
FILES YOU HAVE TO RUN:-
1. user defined facial extraction.ipynb
2. Face Recognition part 1 pc .ipynb
3. Face Recognition part 2 youtube.ipynb 
4. Face Recognition part 3 webcam.ipynb
We can run any of the files 2, 3 or 4 it depends on the user input. Running 1 is compulsary.
